# Heap packaging
Builds deb packages for things not publicly available.

# Why does this exist?
In short we should be installing any dependency via a package manager of some description, but some projects don't provide deb packages. This builds simple packages for those projects that we can host on an internal apt repository.

Installing via a package manager means that we:
* Get nice versioning and simplified installs via configuration management
* More predicatable instance creation, no download links are dead or codebases no longer compiling
* Less need for development tools and compilers on production instances

# How do I use this?
The project aims to create a vagrant VM for any common packaging requirements. These VM's should build any packages during the provisioning stage, i.e users should be able to run `vagrant up <machine> && vagrant destroy <machine>` and have all packages available within the root directory.

A `tester` vagrant machine is available as a clean image for testing package installs.

Packaging machines currently available:
* bosun
* postgres (builds a range of postgres extensions)

`vagrant up` might fail with error on `fpm` gem install. In this case, SSH into the failing box and run `sudo gem install fpm --no-rdoc --no-ri` manually.

## Pushing updated packages to the heap repo
The `upload.sh` script should be used to push any updated packages to an S3 backed apt repository. To use it:
- install [deb-s3](https://github.com/krobertson/deb-s3)
- `export BUCKET=heap-apt-repo` (the S3 bucket holding the apt repo)
- `export GPG_KEY=02F09197` (The GPG key ID used for signing the repository manifests)
- `brew install gpg`
- Get the GPG key from someone and then run `gpg --import <path-to-key>`
- `../infrastructure/terraform/getTemporaryCredentials.coffee --readwrite` (from the http://github.com/heap/infrastructure repo, make sure that you have terraform installed and setup)
- `./upload.sh <path-to-file>`

Pushing packages to Heap apt repository does not guarantee that the latest version will be installed by salt, although it is possible to set this up.
Please refer to [heap/infrastructure](https://github.com/heap/infrastructure) for details.

## Viewing current packages
You may want to list out the packages currently present in the Heap apt repository.
- If you don't have temporary aws credentials, run `getTemporaryCredentials.coffee` as outlined above.
- `export BUCKET=heap-apt-repo`
- `deb-s3 list --bucket $BUCKET`

# How do I add a new package?
If your package doesn't fit nicely into one of the existing vagrant machines then you'll need to create a new instance. Check the `Vagrantfile` for the current usage. Each new machine must have the hostname set so that it can be targetted via Salt, you'll need to add this targetting to `salt/top.sls`.

Assuming you have a build host available, any steps required to package the new dependency should be added to the salt formulas for that build host. These will likely include: downloading sources or binaries, setting up install directory structures and packaging those structures via [fpm](https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm).
